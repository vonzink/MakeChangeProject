 ## Lessons Learned

 -	i cant pass a method into another method or if i can, i cant figure out how. i have to store the result in variable and then pass the variable.  

 - i have to declare the variable outside the loop if i want to use it in all the if statements. 


 ## Notes

 I switched amountTendered to amountReceived for my own clarity. 
 I turned the whole gathering of data into its own method. 
commit. 

I made extra variables to store the results of each item in the after I Mod it. took me a while because i created all the variables but dint inital them to 0. 

 i tried using regular if statements, didnt work, need to next if else if statments in a while loop. I removed the extra variables
